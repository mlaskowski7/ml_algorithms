## Lecture 1.

### What are the features of intelligence?

- learning (on examples)
- solving complex problems
- adaptation (to dynamic situation)
- reasoning (based on knowledge and rules)
- perception (vision, hearing)
- generalisation (of observed cases)
- communication (language)
- planning
- and other ...

### AI has numerous inter-related fields e.g:

- computational intelligence
- evolutionary and other bio-inspired optimisation heuristics
- knowledge acquisition and management
- pattern recognition
- machine learning
- NLP (natural language processing)
- deep learning
- reinforcement learning

**Machine Learning:** <br />
It is an approach to solve problems that are hard to precisely specify by making that computers/algorithms:
- learn on examples (eg. data)
- apply automatically learnt (hierarchy of) concepts to "understand" the domain of solved problem

### Strategies to approach AI

1. symbolic (logic, representation)
2. computational (intensively searching the solution space)
3. data-centric (data, data science, statistics and probability)

### Turing Test
- A and B communicates within each other in natural language (text)
- one of them is human
- the other is a machine pretending to be a human
- C observes the communication
- can C figure out who is a human and which is a machine?
<br /> (turing test concerns only some aspects of AI)
- **NO SYSTEM PASSED TURING TEST SO FAR**

### Strong and weak AI
- weak AI (narrow aspects, particular problems, etc.)
  - ability to solve particular complex problems
  - knowledge representation
  - adaptivity
  - learning
  - reasoning
- strong AI (general intelligence)
  - all of the above
  - consciousness
  - creativity
  - awareness of self-boundedness
  - evolution

Strong AI is still not achieved (and one can ask what could be a reason to create strong AI)
we focus on weak AI
